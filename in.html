    <h2>
        <p>It is our aim to bulid such kind of drone which 
          will reduce pressure of fire fighter .It will also 
          increase efficeincy of fire fighter as it can enter 
          in most dangerous situation .There will be no delay 
          in handling fire emergency cases ,As it has decision 
          making abilities and fire fighting solution.
        It can also be used for survilience.As it has high defination 
        camera and aerodynamic design to parse air at high speed .
        It is also enabled with Sensors  for object detection so to 
        avoid collision of drone.It can detect object in bothg backward
         and forward direction.
        It also has hd camera which gives complete view from drone's
         point of view</p>
